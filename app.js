//1. create an array that contains (rock, paper and scissors)

//2. create function that generates random number between 0 - 2 and use it with array that you create

//Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"   **Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
